# javasimplegame
A very simple and POJO game that I made from scratch and taking some curses online about it.

I always wanted to make my own games. This is an example of what could it be justa taking baby steps to accomplish my goal. Who knows.
This project use just plain Java and AWT for displaying some little rectangles and nothing more. I need more time to finish this project.
This is a start.
